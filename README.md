## Magic System
7 magic types; fire, water, earth, air, light, void, and gravity
Each type is harder to get with water being the starter.
Mana is required for abilities and casting spells, leveling up your skill for magic decreases casting time and mana consumed. 
Players will start at 100 mana, and regenerate 1 mana per second

Higher level skill unlocks new tiers of magic, and types are unlocked with prestiges. 7 prestiges = all magic types unlocked.

Wands affect the potency of the spell but do not affect abilities, they decrease casting time and mana consumed.
Scrolls are instant-cast, require lots of mana and are one-time use.

Everything uses a special ore called Elementium, and has multiple tiers which are compressed versions of the last. With a max of 7 tiers(for each corresponding type) to be cast at the highest level crystal, costing 4^7 crystals.

- **Tier 1**: Shard of Elementium - Mined directly from Elementium Ore.

## Skill System
Each skill can be leveled up from 1 to 10. Reaching level 10 in a skill allows you to Prestige, resetting the skill level to 1 and providing a permanent bonus. Prestiging a skill 25 times unlocks its full potential. Prestige bonuses can be unique to each skill, such as unlocking new spells, abilities, or powerful passives.

## Perk System

Perks are passive bonuses that provide various benefits to your character, enhancing their abilities, skills, and magic. Players can unlock perks by leveling up their skills and magic.

There are three main categories of perks:

General Perks: These perks provide benefits that are not tied to any specific skill or magic type. They are unlocked by leveling up any skill or magic.
Skill Perks: These perks enhance specific skills, providing unique bonuses related to the corresponding skill. They are unlocked by leveling up the respective skill.
Magic Perks: These perks enhance specific magic types, providing unique bonuses related to the corresponding magic type. They are unlocked by leveling up the respective magic type.
Each perk has a base level (1 to 3) and a perk level (1 to 10). The base level is randomly generated when you unlock a new skill or magic type, and the perk level can be increased by leveling up the corresponding skill or magic type.

Perks can be rerolled by sacrificing items or reaching level 10 in the respective skill or magic type.

## Ability System

Abilities are active enhancements or utilities that players can use to gain an edge in various situations. They are unlocked by leveling up skills and magic. Abilities have different levels (1 to 10), with each level reducing the cooldown and increasing the effectiveness of the ability. Abilities also consume mana when used.

Players can reroll their abilities by reaching level 10 in the respective skill or magic type or by using a reroll ability scroll.

There are three main categories of abilities:

General Abilities: These abilities can be used by any player, regardless of their skills or magic types. They are unlocked by leveling up any skill or magic.
Skill Abilities: These abilities are related to specific skills and provide unique utilities or enhancements based on the corresponding skill. They are unlocked by leveling up the respective skill.
Magic Abilities: These abilities are related to specific magic types and provide unique utilities or enhancements based on the corresponding magic type. They are unlocked by leveling up the respective magic type.

## Custom Blocks/Skills

Magical Harvester: A block that automates farming by simulating crop growth and harvesting. It takes into account the player's farming-related stats but operates at only 25% of their efficiency. The Magical Harvester can be configured and monitored through a custom GUI.

Magical Grinder: A block that automates mob grinding by simulating mob kills and item drops. Similar to the Magical Harvester, it takes into account the player's combat-related stats but operates at only 25% of their efficiency. The Magical Grinder can be configured and monitored through a custom GUI.

Item Bag Skill: A skill that allows players to store items in a magical bag or dimensional pocket, which can be accessed from anywhere. As the player levels up this skill, they can unlock higher storage capacities or additional functionality like auto-sorting or remote access.

Auto-Compression Skill: A skill that enables players to automatically compress items in their inventory or the magical bag from the Item Bag skill. As the player levels up this skill, the compression rate improves, and they can unlock the ability to compress more item types. The skill can also be leveled up automatically, albeit at a slower rate.
